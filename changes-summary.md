# Game Development Progress Summary

## Character Controller Improvements

1. **Added Maximum Velocity Constraint**
   - Implemented MAX_VELOCITY = 3 to limit character speed
   - Added velocity normalization logic to maintain consistent movement speed
   - Preserves vertical velocity (y-component) during normalization
   - Improves gameplay by preventing the character from moving too fast

```jsx
// Apply max velocity constraint
const currentVel = rigidBodyRef.current.linvel();
if (Math.sqrt(currentVel.x * currentVel.x + currentVel.z * currentVel.z) > MAX_VELOCITY) {
  // Normalize the horizontal velocity and scale to max velocity
  const horizontalSpeed = Math.sqrt(currentVel.x * currentVel.x + currentVel.z * currentVel.z);
  const scale = MAX_VELOCITY / horizontalSpeed;

  // Set the new velocity with the same y component
  rigidBodyRef.current.setLinvel(
    { x: currentVel.x * scale, y: currentVel.y, z: currentVel.z * scale },
    true
  );
}
```

2. **Improved Floor Detection for Jumping**
   - Implemented velocity-based floor detection
   - Character can only jump when on a surface (not moving vertically)
   - Prevents unintended jumps when colliding with crates

```jsx
// Check if character is on floor using velocity
const onFloor = checkIfOnFloor();

// Handle jumping - only when on floor
if (jump && onFloor) {
  // Apply jump force
  setIsOnFloor(false); // Set to false immediately after jumping
  rigidBodyRef.current.applyImpulse({ x: 0, y: JUMP_FORCE, z: 0 }, true);
}
```

## Crate Improvements

1. **Added More Crate Variations**
   - Single crates with different scales (511.0-511.8)
   - Crate stacks (2-3 crates high) for vertical gameplay elements
   - Crate row (3 crates in a line) as a barrier/puzzle element

2. **Fixed Crate Alignment**
   - Adjusted crate model position to align with colliders
   - Added position={[0, -0.4, 0]} to center crates within colliders
   - Ensures crates appear to sit on the ground rather than floating

3. **Optimized Crate Colliders**
   - Reduced collider size from [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] to [0.4, 0.4, 0.4]
   - Better fit between visual model and physics representation
   - Improved physics interactions

```jsx
<RigidBody type="dynamic" position={[3, GROUND_LEVEL + 0.5, 2]} restitution={0.2} colliders={false}>
  <CrateInstance scale={511.5} />
  <CuboidCollider args={[0.4, 0.4, 0.4]} position={[0, 0, 0]} />
</RigidBody>
```

## Visual Improvements

1. **Added Water Plane**
   - Added a blue water plane at y=-1 to surround the stage
   - Prevents the void appearance beyond the stage edges
   - Used a semi-transparent material for better performance

```jsx
<mesh
  position={[0, GROUND_LEVEL - 1, 0]}
  rotation={[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}
  receiveShadow
>
  <planeGeometry args={[50, 50]} />
  <meshStandardMaterial
    color="#4d80e4"
    metalness={0.2}
    roughness={0.7}
    transparent={true}
    opacity={0.8}
  />
</mesh>
```

2. **Enhanced Sky**
   - Configured the Sky component in Experience.jsx
   - Created a proper horizon where the blue water meets the sky
   - Added depth and context to the game world

3. **Improved Shadows**
   - Implemented soft shadows using PCFShadowMap
   - Added shadow-bias, shadow-radius, and shadow-normalBias for better quality
   - Added ContactShadows for more defined ground shadows
   - Enabled shadows for trees and grass

```jsx
<ContactShadows
  position={[0, GROUND_LEVEL + 0.001, 0]}
  scale={40}
  blur={2}
  opacity={0.7}
  far={8}
  resolution={512}
  color="#000000"
  frames={1}
/>
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Optimized Shadow Settings**
   - Balanced shadow map size (512x512) for performance and quality
   - Used PCFShadowMap instead of PCFSoftShadowMap for better performance
   - Optimized shadow camera frustum for more focused shadows

2. **Reduced Scene Complexity**
   - Decreased grass patch counts for better performance
   - Optimized Canvas settings with limited pixel ratio
   - Removed unnecessary components and debug features

```jsx
<Canvas
  shadows={{ type: 'PCFShadowMap' }}
  camera={{ position: [0, 6, 14], fov: 42 }}
  dpr={[0.8, 1.2]}
  performance={{ min: 0.6 }}
>
```

3. **Fixed Physics Issues**
   - Cleared Vite cache to resolve module loading errors
   - Reinstalled Rapier physics library for proper functionality
   - Removed problematic frameloop settings

## Game Mechanics Implementation

1. **Added Button Platforms**
   - Created two button platforms at different heights:
     - First platform: 2 crates high (height=4 units)
     - Second platform: 3 crates high (height=6 units)
   - Implemented pressure-sensitive buttons on top of each platform
   - Buttons change color when pressed (red to green)

```jsx
{/* Platform 1 - 2 crates high */}
<group position={[6, GROUND_LEVEL, 0]}>
  {/* Platform cylinder */}
  <RigidBody type="fixed" colliders={false}>
    <CylinderCollider args={[2, 1]} />
    <mesh receiveShadow castShadow>
      <cylinderGeometry args={[1, 1, 4, 32]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="#777777" />
    </mesh>
  </RigidBody>

  {/* Button on top */}
  <Button
    position={[0, 2, 0]} /* Position at the top of the cylinder */
    buttonId="button-1"
  />
</group>
```

2. **Enhanced Game State Management**
   - Updated the game store to handle button interactions
   - Connected both buttons to the same door (door-1)
   - Door opens only when both buttons are pressed simultaneously

```js
// Update a specific pressure plate
updatePressurePlate: (id, isPressed) => set((state) => {
  // Update the specific pressure plate
  const updatedPressurePlates = state.pressurePlates.map((plate) =>
    plate.id === id ? { ...plate, isPressed } : plate
  );

  // Check if all plates for a door are pressed
  const doorStates = {};

  // Group plates by doorId
  updatedPressurePlates.forEach(plate => {
    if (!doorStates[plate.doorId]) {
      doorStates[plate.doorId] = [];
    }
    doorStates[plate.doorId].push(plate.isPressed);
  });

  // Update doors based on pressure plates
  const updatedDoors = state.doors.map(door => {
    // Get all plates for this door
    const doorPlates = doorStates[door.id] || [];
    // Door is open if ALL plates for this door are pressed
    const isOpen = doorPlates.length > 0 && doorPlates.every(isPressed => isPressed);
    return { ...door, isOpen };
  });

  return {
    pressurePlates: updatedPressurePlates,
    doors: updatedDoors
  };
});
```

3. **Puzzle Design**
   - Players need to activate both buttons simultaneously to open the door
   - Strategic challenge: players can push crates onto buttons or stand on them
   - Encourages experimentation and problem-solving

## Technical Improvements

1. **Consolidated Store Management**
   - Ensured all components use the same game store
   - Implemented consistent state management across components
   - Maintained a single source of truth for game state

2. **Fixed Component Structure**
   - Improved button platform implementation for better height alignment
   - Ensured proper collider setup for all game objects
   - Maintained clean separation of concerns in component hierarchy

3. **World Organization**
   - All elements are positioned relative to GROUND_LEVEL = 0
   - Tree colliders are positioned at y=1.5 to properly surround the tree models
   - World component contains all game elements
   - Experience component handles high-level scene setup
