# Recent Changes Summary

## Character Controller Improvements

1. **Added Maximum Velocity Constraint**
   - Implemented MAX_VELOCITY = 3 to limit character speed
   - Added velocity normalization logic to maintain consistent movement speed
   - Preserves vertical velocity (y-component) during normalization
   - Improves gameplay by preventing the character from moving too fast

```jsx
// Apply max velocity constraint
const currentVel = rigidBodyRef.current.linvel();
if (Math.sqrt(currentVel.x * currentVel.x + currentVel.z * currentVel.z) > MAX_VELOCITY) {
  // Normalize the horizontal velocity and scale to max velocity
  const horizontalSpeed = Math.sqrt(currentVel.x * currentVel.x + currentVel.z * currentVel.z);
  const scale = MAX_VELOCITY / horizontalSpeed;
  
  // Set the new velocity with the same y component
  rigidBodyRef.current.setLinvel(
    { x: currentVel.x * scale, y: currentVel.y, z: currentVel.z * scale },
    true
  );
}
```

## Crate Additions

1. **Added More Crate Variations**
   - Single crates with different scales (1.2-1.8)
   - Crate stacks (2-3 crates high) for vertical gameplay elements
   - Crate row (3 crates in a line) as a barrier/puzzle element

2. **Crate Positioning**
   - Ground level crates at GROUND_LEVEL + 0.5
   - Second level crates at GROUND_LEVEL + 1.5
   - Third level crates at GROUND_LEVEL + 2.5

3. **Physics Properties**
   - All crates have restitution=0.2 for slight bounciness
   - All crates are dynamic RigidBodies that can be pushed by the character

```jsx
{/* Crate stack example */}
<RigidBody type="dynamic" position={[5, GROUND_LEVEL + 0.5, 5]} restitution={0.2}>
  <CrateInstance scale={1.4} />
</RigidBody>

<RigidBody type="dynamic" position={[5, GROUND_LEVEL + 1.5, 5]} restitution={0.2}>
  <CrateInstance scale={1.2} />
</RigidBody>

<RigidBody type="dynamic" position={[5, GROUND_LEVEL + 2.5, 5]} restitution={0.2}>
  <CrateInstance scale={1.0} />
</RigidBody>
```

## World Organization

The game continues to use the World component approach for scene organization:

1. **Consistent Ground Level**
   - All elements are positioned relative to GROUND_LEVEL = 0
   - This ensures consistent alignment across all game elements

2. **Proper Collider Alignment**
   - Tree colliders are positioned at y=1.5 to properly surround the tree models
   - Crate colliders are automatically generated based on the mesh geometry

3. **Hierarchical Structure**
   - World component contains all game elements
   - Experience component handles high-level scene setup
   - This separation of concerns makes the code more maintainable
