# Recent Changes Summary

## Improved Floor Detection for Jumping

1. **Implemented Velocity-Based Floor Detection**
   - Replaced collision-based floor detection with velocity checks
   - Uses the character's vertical velocity to determine if it's on the floor
   - If the vertical velocity is very small (< 0.1), the character is considered to be on the floor

```jsx
// Function to check if character is on floor using velocity
const checkIfOnFloor = () => {
  if (!rigidBodyRef.current) return false;
  
  // Get the character's current velocity
  const velocity = rigidBodyRef.current.linvel();
  
  // If the vertical velocity is very small, we're probably on the floor
  return Math.abs(velocity.y) < 0.1;
};
```

2. **Continuous Floor Detection in Game Loop**
   - Added floor detection check in the `useFrame` function
   - Updates the `isOnFloor` state only when the floor status changes
   - Uses the velocity check result directly for jump logic

```jsx
// Check if character is on floor using velocity
const onFloor = checkIfOnFloor();

// Update isOnFloor state if it changed
if (onFloor !== isOnFloor) {
  setIsOnFloor(onFloor);
}

// Handle jumping - only when on floor
if (jump && onFloor) {
  // Apply jump force
  setIsOnFloor(false); // Set to false immediately after jumping
  rigidBodyRef.current.applyImpulse({ x: 0, y: JUMP_FORCE, z: 0 }, true);
}
```

3. **Increased Jump Force**
   - Increased JUMP_FORCE from 2 to 5 for more noticeable jumps
   - This makes the jumping action more satisfying and visible

## Key Benefits

1. **More Reliable Jump Control**
   - Character can jump whenever it's not moving vertically
   - This approach is more reliable than collision detection for this specific game
   - Works regardless of what the character is standing on

2. **Simpler Implementation**
   - Doesn't rely on complex collision detection logic
   - Uses the physics engine's built-in velocity information
   - This approach is both simple and effective for this specific game setup
