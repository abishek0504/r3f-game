# Recent Changes Summary

## Fine-Tuned Crate Visual Alignment

1. **Adjusted Crate Model Position**
   - Changed the crate model position from [0, -0.5, 0] to [0, -0.4, 0]
   - This moves the visual model up slightly to better align with the collider
   - Provides a more accurate visual representation of the physics object

```jsx
// Updated crate position for better alignment
export function CrateInstance({ position = [0, 0, 0], rotation = [0, 0, 0], scale = 1 }) {
  return (
    <group position={position} rotation={rotation}>
      <Crate scale={scale} position={[0, -0.4, 0]} />
    </group>
  )
}
```

2. **Visual-Physics Alignment**
   - The crate visual model is now better centered within its collider
   - This ensures that physics interactions look more natural
   - The wireframe collider should now properly surround the visual model

## Key Insights

1. **Fine-Tuning Visual Alignment**
   - Small adjustments to model positioning can significantly improve visual-physics alignment
   - The position value of -0.4 provides a better balance than the previous -0.5
   - This type of fine-tuning is common in game development to ensure visuals match physics behavior

2. **Maintaining Scale and Collider Size**
   - We've maintained the large scale values (511.x) for proper visibility
   - The smaller colliders ([0.4, 0.4, 0.4]) are still in place for better physics
   - Only the visual positioning needed adjustment
