# Recent Changes Summary

## Optimized Water Plane for Better Performance

1. **Simplified Water Material**
   - Replaced resource-intensive MeshReflectorMaterial with a simpler meshStandardMaterial
   - Added transparency (opacity=0.8) for a water-like appearance
   - Maintained the same blue color (#4d80e4)
   - Kept metalness and roughness properties for visual quality

```jsx
<mesh rotation={[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]} receiveShadow>
  <planeGeometry args={[100, 100]} />
  <meshStandardMaterial 
    color="#4d80e4"
    metalness={0.2}
    roughness={0.7}
    transparent={true}
    opacity={0.8}
  />
</mesh>
```

2. **Performance Benefits**
   - Significantly reduced GPU load by removing reflections and distortions
   - Eliminated the high-resolution texture calculations
   - Maintained the visual boundary of the game world
   - Improved overall frame rate and responsiveness

3. **Visual Quality Balance**
   - The semi-transparent blue material still provides a water-like appearance
   - The simplified material maintains the visual boundary without the performance cost
   - The water still provides context to the game world and prevents the "void" feeling

## Key Insights

1. **Performance vs. Visual Quality**
   - High-quality reflections and distortions can significantly impact performance
   - For a game like this, a simpler material with transparency can achieve a similar visual effect
   - It's important to balance visual quality with performance, especially for web-based games

2. **Optimization Approach**
   - Identified the performance bottleneck (complex material with reflections)
   - Replaced with a simpler alternative that maintains the core visual function
   - Kept the physics behavior unchanged for consistent gameplay
