# Recent Changes Summary

## Fixed Sky Visibility and Water Plane Size

1. **Reduced Water Plane Size**
   - Decreased the water plane size from 100x100 to 50x50
   - This prevents the water from obscuring the sky
   - Creates a better visual boundary for the game world

```jsx
{/* WATER PLANE - Reduced size to not obscure the sky */}
<mesh
  position={[0, GROUND_LEVEL - 1, 0]}
  rotation={[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}
  receiveShadow
>
  <planeGeometry args={[50, 50]} /> {/* Reduced from 100x100 to 50x50 */}
  <meshStandardMaterial
    color="#4d80e4"
    metalness={0.2}
    roughness={0.7}
    transparent={true}
    opacity={0.8}
  />
</mesh>
```

2. **Enhanced Sky Configuration**
   - Added turbidity parameter for better atmospheric scattering
   - Adjusted sun position and azimuth for better lighting
   - These changes make the sky more visible and realistic

```jsx
<Sky
  distance={450000}
  sunPosition={[5, 1, 0]}
  inclination={0.6}
  azimuth={0.25}
  rayleigh={0.5}
  turbidity={8}
/>
```

3. **Updated Canvas Background Color**
   - Changed the background color from #dbecfb to #87ceeb (sky blue)
   - This ensures a sky-like appearance even if the Sky component isn't fully visible
   - Creates a consistent sky-like background throughout the scene

```jsx
<color attach="background" args={["#87ceeb"]} /> {/* Sky blue background */}
```

## Visual Improvements

1. **Better Horizon Effect**
   - The smaller water plane creates a clearer horizon line
   - The sky blue background ensures the sky is visible beyond the water
   - The enhanced Sky component parameters create a more realistic atmosphere

2. **Balanced Visual Elements**
   - Water plane is still large enough to create the illusion of an endless water surface
   - Sky is now visible and creates a proper environmental context
   - The stage and game elements stand out better against the sky background
