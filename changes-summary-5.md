# Recent Changes Summary

## Improved Crate Colliders

1. **Smaller Colliders for Better Fit**
   - Reduced all crate colliders from [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] to [0.4, 0.4, 0.4]
   - This makes the colliders slightly smaller to better fit the visual model
   - Provides more precise physics interactions

```jsx
// Example of updated crate collider
<RigidBody type="dynamic" position={[3, GROUND_LEVEL + 0.5, 2]} restitution={0.2} colliders={false}>
  <CrateInstance scale={511.5} />
  <CuboidCollider args={[0.4, 0.4, 0.4]} position={[0, 0, 0]} />
</RigidBody>
```

2. **Explicit Colliders for All Crates**
   - Added explicit CuboidCollider components to all crates
   - Set colliders={false} on all RigidBody components to disable auto-generated colliders
   - This gives more control over the physics behavior

3. **Maintained Visual Positioning**
   - Kept the crate model position at [0, -0.5, 0] to center it within the collider
   - This ensures the crate appears to sit on the ground properly

## Key Insights

1. **Collider Size vs. Visual Size**
   - Colliders should generally be slightly smaller than the visual model
   - This prevents "floating" effects and makes physics interactions more realistic
   - The [0.4, 0.4, 0.4] size provides a good balance between stability and precision

2. **Custom Colliders vs. Auto-Generated**
   - Using custom colliders (with colliders={false} on the RigidBody) gives more control
   - This approach allows for fine-tuning the physics behavior
   - It's especially useful for objects with complex shapes or specific interaction requirements
