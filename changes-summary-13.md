# Recent Changes Summary

## Improved Sky Configuration

1. **Updated Sky Component in Experience.jsx**
   - Identified that the Sky component was already present in Experience.jsx
   - Enhanced the Sky configuration with better parameters
   - Removed redundant Sky component from World.jsx
   - Created a proper horizon where the blue water meets the sky

```jsx
<Sky
  distance={450000}
  sunPosition={[0, 1, 0]}
  inclination={0.6}
  azimuth={0.1}
  rayleigh={0.5}
/>
```

2. **Simplified Water Plane**
   - Maintained the water plane as a simple mesh with transparent material
   - Positioned at y=-1 (1 unit below the stage)
   - Creates a clear boundary for the game world

```jsx
{/* WATER PLANE */}
<mesh
  position={[0, GROUND_LEVEL - 1, 0]}
  rotation={[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}
  receiveShadow
>
  <planeGeometry args={[100, 100]} />
  <meshStandardMaterial
    color="#4d80e4"
    metalness={0.2}
    roughness={0.7}
    transparent={true}
    opacity={0.8}
  />
</mesh>
```

## Visual Improvements

1. **Complete Environment**
   - The sky creates a natural horizon line
   - The blue water no longer extends infinitely upward
   - Creates a more realistic and immersive game world

2. **Optimized Component Structure**
   - Sky component is now properly managed in Experience.jsx
   - Removed redundant components for better performance
   - Maintained clean separation of concerns in the component hierarchy

3. **Sky Parameters**
   - distance: 450000 - Creates a realistic atmosphere depth
   - sunPosition: [0, 1, 0] - Places the sun high in the sky
   - inclination: 0.6 - Controls the sun's height in the sky
   - azimuth: 0.1 - Controls the sun's horizontal position
   - rayleigh: 0.5 - Controls the atmosphere's scattering effect
